# YouTube Data Analysis with Python & AWS
## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "YouTube Data Analysis with Python & AWS" project! This project is an exploration of data engineering techniques using Amazon Web Services (AWS) for analyzing structured and semi-structured data from popular YouTube videos. The primary focus is on extracting daily statistics, implementing efficient ETL pipelines, and deriving meaningful insights through data analysis.

## Project Objectives

üéØ The main objectives of this project include:

- **Data Ingestion:** Seamless acquisition of daily statistics of popular YouTube videos.
- **ETL Pipeline:** Implementation of a robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline using AWS Glue Spark jobs.
- **Data Lake Implementation:** Building a cost-efficient data lake in Amazon S3, designed in layers for optimal cost performance.
- **Scalability Assurance:** Ensuring scalability through best practices in Lake house architecture design.
- **Cloud Integration (AWS):** Leveraging various AWS services such as S3, IAM, Glue, Lambda, Athena, and QuickSight.
- **Insights Using QuickSight:** Extracting meaningful insights and creating a business intelligence dashboard in Amazon QuickSight.
